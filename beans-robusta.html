      <h2>BEANS | Robusta</h2>
      <p>
        The second most popular type of coffee bean is Robusta. 
        This bean originated in sub-Saharan Africa and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia. 
        It’s a less expensive variety, making it a very budget-friendly choice for roasters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robusta beans are larger and more rounded than the other bean varieties. 
        They are typically considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and 
        resist diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people think that Robusta coffee is harsher and more bitter. 
        It often has a strong smell and a somewhat flat, almost burnt taste. 
        Robusta beans also have significantly more caffeine than Arabica beans. 
        Though many fans of gourmet coffee turn up their noses at Robusta, 
        we’d recommend trying it every once in a while.
