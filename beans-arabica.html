        <h2>BEANS | Arabica</h2>
        <p>
          Arabica beans are by far the most popular type of coffee beans, 
          making up about 60% of the world’s coffee. These beans originated in the highlands of Ethiopia, 
          and may even be the first coffee beans ever consumed! 
          The name Arabica likely comes from the beans’ popularity in 7th-century Arabia (present-day Yemen).
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Arabica beans are harder to grow, they tend to be a bit pricier. 
          They need extra shade, water, and high altitude to grow properly compared to their other varieties. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Arabica coffee beans are considered the most high-quality variety. 
          They’re known for their smooth, complex flavor and distinct lack of bitterness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on where they’re grown, Arabica beans can offer many different tasting notes, 
          from earthy Indonesian to floral Ethiopian. 
          If you want to amaze your tastebuds, pick up a bag of single-origin Arabica beans!
