        <h2>BEANS | Excelsa</h2>
        <p>The fourth major type of coffee bean is called Excelsa. 
          Though it was once considered a separate coffee species, 
          scientists recently reclassified it as a Liberica variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excelsa beans grow almost entirely in Southeast Asia, 
          and they’re shaped somewhat like Liberica beans — elongated ovals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of flavor, Excelsa beans are pretty unique. 
          They combine light roast traits like tart notes and fruity flavors 
          with flavors that are more reminiscent of dark roasts. 
          They’re also lighter on aroma and caffeine — while maintaining an unusual depth of flavor. 
          You can sometimes find these unusual beans in blends because they add complexity.
        </p>
