      <h2>BEANS | Liberica</h2>
      <p>
        Native to central and western Africa – specifically Liberia, hence its name – 
        Coffea liberica is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor profile. 
        This hardy species is frequently mixed with other varieties to add body and complexity, 
        but rarely receives any credit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing from a much larger plant than Arabica or Robusta, 
        most Liberica cherries tend to be irregular in shape and closer to Robusta in size and general appearance. 
        The bean makes up roughly 2% of the world’s coffee supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among enthusiasts, Liberica coffee has a controversial and polarizing reputation for 
        wild inconsistency. Those who’ve tried this rare variety either love it or hate it. 
        Some coffee drinkers adore the unusual, nutty, woody flavor and sneaky backbite on the finish. 
        Others compare the flavor to burnt garbage.
