        <h2>Coffee Production</h2>
        <div class="cultivation"><h3>Cultivation</h3></div>
        <p>
          Climatic factors most important for coffee growth are temperature and rainfall. 
          No variety can withstand a temperature in the vicinity of 32 °F (0 °C). 
          Temperatures between 73 and 82 °F (23 and 28 °C) are the most favourable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plantations are established in cleared forestland or modified forests. 
          The young coffee plants are spaced in rows so that the density varies between 
          1,200 and 1,800 plants per hectare (500 and 750 plants per acre). 
          Seedlings or cuttings raised in nurseries are carefully planted 
          at the beginning of the rainy season; until they start producing fruit 
          three to four years later, their care is limited largely to the trimming 
          required to give them a strong, balanced framework and to stimulate fruiting.
        </p>
        <h3>Shade-grown and Sun-grown Coffee</h3>
        <p>
          Both shade-grown and sun-grown can be considered a form of permaculture (“permanent agriculture”) or agroforestry, 
          and a diversity of shade-giving trees is usually encouraged to promote ecological interactions within the system. 
          Some of these interactions directly benefit coffee production, such as improved nutrient cycling 
          and the provision of habitat for pest-eating birds and useful pollinators, 
          while others are more broadly beneficial, such as improved carbon sequestration and water filtration, 
          decreased soil erosion, and the preservation of biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shade-grown coffee is considered more labour-intensive than sun-grown coffee and produces lower yields. 
          However, it produces a superior flavour in the beans and is frequently sold at higher prices as a specialty coffee. 
          In the late 20th and early 21st centuries there was renewed interest in shade-grown coffee as a 
          sustainable farming method, and most organic coffee was shade-grown. 
          In 2021 about 25 percent of global coffee production was considered shade-grown.
        </p>
        <h3>Harvesting and processing</h3>
        <p>
          The ripened fruits of the coffee plant are known as coffee cherries, and each cherry generally 
          contains two coffee seeds (“beans”) positioned flat against one another. 
          About 5 percent of cherries contain only one seed; called peaberries, 
          those single seeds are smaller and denser and produce, in the opinion of some, a sweeter, more flavourful coffee. 
          The fruit is gathered by hand when it is fully ripe and red-purple in colour.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cherries are processed by disengaging the coffee seeds from their coverings 
          and from the pulp and by drying the seeds from an original moisture content of 65–70 percent water 
          by weight to 12–13 percent; all beans must be removed from their fruit and dried before roasting. 
          Three techniques are used for processing the coffee: the dry, or “natural,” process, 
          the wet (and washed) process, and a hybrid process called the semi-washed, or “pulped natural,” method. 
          The coffee resulting from these processes is called green coffee, which is then ready for roasting.
        </p>
        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <p>
          The prolonged storage of coffee in the producing countries presents problems, 
          especially in the warm and humid coastal regions, where molds and parasites may develop and cause damage; 
          for that reason coffee from those areas is exported as quickly as possible. 
          In moderate climates the conservation of dry lots does not pose a problem as long as 
          they are stocked in well-ventilated places.
        </p>
        <h3>Grading</h3>
        <p>
          The practice of grading and classifying coffee gives sellers and buyers a guarantee concerning 
          the origin, nature, and quality of the product to aid in negotiations. 
          Each coffee-producing country has a certain number of defined types and grades—based on characteristics 
          such as growing altitude and region, botanical variety, method of processing, roast appearance, and bean size, 
          density, and defects—but there is no universal grading and classification system.
